# CMU Printers
### Because right now, it's pretty awful.

This project attempts to make the printer system at CMU navigatable, by providing users
with access to the closest working printer, as well as report on the status of the various printers around campus.
That's right: you no longer have to guess what printer on the way to class is working. 

Check it out [here!][demo]


### Features
* Responsive design! Yeah!
* Geolocation, because phones can do that.
* Updates as recent as CMU's ancient website will let me.
* Good vibrations.


### Installation
1. ```git clone https://github.com/bichiliad/cmuPrinters.git``` (Or click the download zip button)
2. Plop it on a web server somewhere.
3. Navigate to ```index.html```.


## Notes
This works best if you're near CMU campus. 
Also, there are a few bugs here and there, so if you find anything, let me know!
